# Contribution Guidelines

If you have something awesome to contribute, this is how you do it:

You'll need a [GitHub account](https://github.com/join). It's free and it's obviously quite awesome.

1. Once you're registered, come back to this repo: https://github.com/IKJ1992/Shelf
2. Select section which you want to contribute to it from `README.md` file: https://github.com/IKJ1992/Shelf/tree/master/sections
3. Now click on the edit icon.
4. You can start editing the text of the file in the in-browser editor. Make sure you follow guidelines below. You can use [GitHub Flavored Markdown](https://help.github.com/articles/github-flavored-markdown/). 
5. Say why you're proposing the changes, and then click on "Propose file change".
6. Submit the [pull request](https://help.github.com/articles/using-pull-requests/)!

Please verify that your pull request follows these guidelines:

- Search previous suggestions before making a new one, as yours may be a duplicate.
- Make an individual pull request for each suggestion.
- Titles should be capitalized.
- Use the following format for links: `- [List Name](link)`
- You can add the pdf or other version of your documentation in `resources` folder and then link from the `resources` like other docs which you can see.
- Link additions should be added to the bottom of the relevant category.
- New categories or improvements to the existing categorization are welcome.
- Check your spelling and grammar.
- The pull requests and commits should have useful titles.

We appreciate your suggestions, so don't worry too much! üòçüòé
